# WCF Service Host

The WCF Service Auto Host (WcfSvcHost.exe) allows you to launch the Visual Studio debugger (F5) to automatically host and test a service you have implemented. You can then test the service using the WCF Test Client (wcfTestClient.exe) or your own client to find and fix any potential errors.
